## Simple Summary:
This proposal sets final parameters for Promo D1SKs and extends the launch window for Illuvitars Wave 2.

## Overview:
A top-tier gaming partner has been identified by Illuvium Labs and approved by the IMC for Illuvitar Wave 2 Promo D1SKs. For effective engagement with the partner community, an extension is needed to allow marketing activations to occur for the Promo sale.

The new end date for Illuvium Wave 2, including the completion of the Promo sale will be January 15, 2024. Improvements based on community feedback from the Wave 1 Promo D1SKs will be incorporated into the Wave 2 Promo D1SKs including the quantity and type of assets.

## Implementation:

#### Promo Approval & Timing
The details of the Promotional partner have been approved by the IMC and Illuvium Labs. A 7-day Promo D1SK sales window with this partner will take place in December 2023 with exact dates to be announced by Illuvium Labs in advance.

#### Wave 2 Extension
The Illuvitar Wave 2 sale will be extended to January 15th to allow new Illuvium: Beyond players from the promo sale to participate fully after the Promo window ends.

#### Promo D1SK Contents
Future Illuvium Promo D1SKs (including Wave 2) will contain 5 assets:
    • 1 Promo Illuvitar (pre-bonded accessories)
    • 3 Accessories; same weighting as a Mega D1SK of the wave
    • 1 Guaranteed Rare Illuvitar; same weighting as a Mega D1SK of the wave

#### Promo D1SK Prices
The price point in ETH for the Wave 2 Promo D1SKs will be announced by Illuvium Labs before the time of the sale.

## Rationale:
No further Wave sales are planned until open beta launch. This allows players to continue with the current wave to avoid a long gap between Wave 2 and Wave 3.

Additionally, the worst experience for new players coming into Illuvium:Beyond is for them not to be able to participate directly in the Wave they are joining and have to resort only to secondary markets. Extending the sale by an additional few weeks after the end of the Promo sale allows players to buy from both Illuvium directly and the secondary market as other players during the wave.
